## Notes

Challenges encountered:
- Setting up Vite and React environment for the first time  
- Understanding the difference between `props` in `Card.jsx` and the `place` object in `.map()` inside `App.jsx`  
- Debugging small issues like path imports (`./Card.jsx`) and cleaning up leftover Vite starter code
